## IMPT - 2015 PLANS

As of 17 Jan 2015 The milestones are as follows:

* The **0.0.2** milestone will be for bug fixes and more tests
* The **0.0.3** milestone will contain more functionality for tree


## Demo

Do you want to see model in action? Visit {http://localhost:3000}

## Installation

Installation is easy as puremodels has minimal dependencies - only the AngularJS and Bootstrap's CSS are required.

When you are done downloading all the dependencies and project files the only remaining part is to add dependencies on the `ng-puremodels` AngularJS module:

```javascript
angular.module('myModule', ['ng-puremodels']);
```

Project files are also available through your favourite package manager:
* **Bower**: `bower install ng-puremodels`

## Support

Project's issue on GitHub should be used discuss bugs and features.

## FAQ

## Supported browsers

Directives from this repository are automatically tested with the following browsers:
* Chrome (stable and canary channel)
* Firefox
* IE 9 and 10
* Opera
* Safari

Modern mobile browsers should work without problems.

**IE 8 is not supported**.

We are  NOT  testing against IE8.

## Project philosophy

### Native, lightweight models

We are aiming at providing a set of AngularJS models for better MVC

Good luck with puremodels!
